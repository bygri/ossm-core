          OSSM is an open-source interpretation of the multi-player strategic sports management game.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Here's the first principles of the project.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A focus on community, building links between people through both playing the game and developing it.</li>
          <li>Democratic design, where the direction of the game is determined by those who play it.</li>
          <li>Free to play and free to win, ensured by keeping the source code freely available for anybody to run their own game instance.</li>
          <li>There is no need for off-site management tools or paid add-ons, but API access is open for those who wish to use it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Some initial goals and ambitions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Option for multiple linked teams (men's, women's, B-teams) in multiple sports (football, cricket). Football will be the first focus.</li>
          <li>Greater emphasis on tactics, with real-time substitutes and tactics changes available even during a match.</li>
          <li>Real-world weather and locations.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>We need your help!</h2>
        <p>
          Designers and developers are welcome, of course, but most of all we need players to give the game strategic
          direction and vote on changes. There's also plenty of non-coding work that needs doing, so feel free
          to help out no matter your skills.
