    {% trans "OSSM is a re-envisioning of the multi-player strategic sports management game." %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% trans "Here's the first principles of the project." %}
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>A focus on community, building links between people through both playing the game and developing it.</li>
    <li>Democratic design, where the direction of the game is determined by those who play it.</li>
    <li>Free to play and free to win, ensured by keeping the source code freely available for anybody to run their own game instance.</li>
    <li>There is no need for off-site management tools or paid add-ons, but API access is open for those who wish to use it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    {% trans "Some initial goals and ambitions:" %}
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Option for multiple linked teams (men's, women's, B-teams) in multiple sports (football, cricket). Football will be the first focus.</li>
    <li>Greater emphasis on tactics, with real-time substitutes and tactics changes available even during a match.</li>
    <li>Real-world weather and locations.</li>
  </ol>

    {% blocktrans %}Designers and developers are welcome, of course, but most of all we need players to give the game strategic
    direction and vote on changes. There's also plenty of non-coding work that needs doing, so feel free
    to help out no matter your skills. {% endblocktrans %}
