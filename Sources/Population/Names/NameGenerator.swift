/**
  Generates names for Sims.

  Set up: after the Geography is prepared, NameGenerator needs to be inited with
  a hash table of Locations along with available first and last names.

  Usage: call `generate(for:)` with a location. NameGenerator will return a Name
  value with a random name. If there are no names available for that location,
  then NameGenerator will throw `NameError.emptyNameList`.
